# Data-Visualization---Working-with-CSV-File-Format
I'll use Python's CSV module to process weather data stored in the CSV format and analyze high and low temperatures over time in two different locations. I'll then use Matplotlib to generate a chart based on our downloaded data to display variations in temperature in two dissimilar environments:  Sitka, Alaska, and Death Valley, California.
